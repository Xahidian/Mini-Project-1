# Mini Project 1 – Banking Campaign Output Prediction
## Author: Md Hasibul Haque Zahid

### Introduction
This project focuses on predicting whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is related to the bank’s direct marketing campaigns, which involve multiple phone calls to the same client. The data includes various attributes such as client information, details about the last contact of the current campaign, and social and economic context attributes. The goal is to predict the binary outcome (‘yes’ or ‘no’) based on these features.

### Models Used
Two machine learning models, Decision Tree and Random Forest, are employed to solve this classification problem. The objective is to build a model that accurately predicts the subscription outcome for a new client given the same input variables.

### Choice of Algorithms
The algorithms chosen for this project were the Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. Here’s 
### why:
-Decision Trees: Decision Trees are simple to understand and interpret, and they can handle both 
numerical and categorical data. They’re also capable of fitting complex datasets.
-Random Forests: Random Forests are an ensemble of Decision Trees. They aggregate the predictions of 
multiple Decision Trees to give a more accurate and stable prediction. They’re less likely to over fit than 
a single Decision Tree.

### Significance
This project has practical implications for the bank, as it can help allocate resources more effectively towards potential clients who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit. By improving the efficiency of marketing campaigns, the bank can enhance its overall performance. Additionally, this study contributes to the broader field of predictive analytics in marketing.

### Features for the Models
The following features are used for the models:

- Client Data: Includes attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, default, housing, and loan.
- Last Contact Details: Contains information about the last contact of the current campaign, including contact method, month, day of the week, and duration.
- Other Attributes: Includes campaign-related features like the number of days since the previous contact (pdays), previous contacts (previous), and outcome of the previous campaign (poutcome).
- Social and Economic Context Attributes: Consists of variables like employment variation rate (emp.var.rate), consumer price index (cons.price.idx), consumer confidence index (cons.conf.idx), euribor 3-month rate (euribor3m), and number of employees (nr.employed). These provide context relevant to the client’s decision-making process.
